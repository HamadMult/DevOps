# DevOps Project

## Overview

This project aims to demonstrate the principles and practices of **DevOps** (Development and Operations). By integrating tools and workflows such as version control, Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), and containerization, this project automates and streamlines software development and deployment.

### Key DevOps Practices Implemented:
- **Version Control** using Git and GitHub.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery** with GitHub Actions.
- **Containerization** using Docker.
- **Serverless Deployment** with AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model).

## Features
- Automated build and test pipelines using GitHub Actions.
- Containerization with Docker for consistent development and production environments.
- Deployment of serverless functions using AWS SAM and AWS CodePipeline.

## Technologies Used

- **Git**: Version control to track and manage code changes.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automating workflows for CI/CD.
- **Docker**: Packaging and running applications in containers for consistency across environments.
- **AWS SAM**: Deploying and managing serverless applications in AWS.
